# Basic lemmas for symmetric powers

This file records small API extensions for Mathlib's symmetric powers, and the map
`TauCeti.Sym.ofFn` reading an ordered `n`-tuple `f : Fin n → α` as an unordered one.

`ofFn` presents `Sym α n` as a quotient of `Fin n → α`: it is surjective, and its fibres are the
orbits of the permutation action, by `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn_eq_ofFn_iff`. Nothing here is topological;
`TauCeti/Topology/Sym/Basic.lean` uses this to give `Sym α n` the quotient topology coinduced along
`ofFn`.

The retained source supplies the useful proof dependencies. Further exact applications,
including their assumptions and boundary cases, are developed in the owning Blueprint.

/-! ### Ordered tuples as unordered ones -/

/-- The ordered `n`-tuple `f : Fin n → α` read as an unordered `n`-tuple.

This is Mathlib's quotient map `Sym.ofVector` precomposed with `List.Vector.ofFn`; the `Fin n → α`
form is the one that carries a product topology, so it is the map that `Sym α n` carries the
quotient topology along in `TauCeti/Topology/Sym/Basic.lean`. -/
def ofFn (f : Fin n → α) : Sym α n :=
  Sym.ofVector (List.Vector.ofFn f)

/-- The multiset underlying `ofFn f` is the list of values of `f`. -/

  congrArg _ (List.Vector.toList_ofFn f)

/-- The multiplicity of a value in `ofFn f` is the number of entries of `f` equal to it. -/

/-- Every unordered `n`-tuple is the image of an ordered one: `ofFn` is the quotient map
presenting `Sym α n` as a quotient of `Fin n → α`. -/

/-! ### The fibres of the quotient map -/

/-- Reindexing an ordered tuple by a permutation leaves the underlying unordered tuple unchanged. -/

/-- Two ordered tuples have the same underlying unordered tuple exactly when one is a reindexing
of the other: the fibres of `ofFn` are the orbits of the permutation action. -/
