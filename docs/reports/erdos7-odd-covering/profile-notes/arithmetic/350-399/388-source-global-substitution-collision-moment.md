# A source-global substitution has an unavoidable coupled collision

The deep prime-prefix transport in report 375 can be sharpened without
changing its source or phase contract. Fix a safe coordinate for one
smaller support prime and use one compatible rooted-tree embedding for the
larger prime at every original label. The pullbacks then cover a complete
new carrier and use fewer original labels. Consequently an EB1 extremizer
cannot have pairwise distinct output numerical moduli: every such common
source map has a collision. Averaging the collisions over the safe
coordinate and the common embedding gives an exact lower bound that keeps
the original phase correlations.

This is a structural obstruction and a quantitative target for the
remaining proof. It is not itself a contradiction: an upper bound below
one for the same collision moment, or a complete-liability repair for the
collisions, is still required.

## 1. Safe source coordinate and one common embedding

Assume a distinct odd whole cover exists and choose an EB1-minimal one,

\[
 \mathcal C=\{A_d=\alpha_d\pmod d:d\in D\},
 \qquad Q=\operatorname{lcm}(D).
\]

Use the divisor closure and comparable-class disjointness from report 350.
Choose support primes \(r<s\), write

\[
 Q=r^A s^B M,\qquad \gcd(M,rs)=1,
\]
and let

\[
 U_r=\{u\pmod {r^A}:
 u\not\equiv\alpha_{r^a}\pmod {r^a}\ (1\le a\le A)\}.
\]

The pure \(r\)-power classes are disjoint, so

\[
 \frac{|U_r|}{r^A}
 =1-\sum_{a=1}^{A}r^{-a}>0. \tag{SC1}
\]

Choose one compatible embedding of rooted digit trees

\[
 \theta_b:\mathbb Z/r^b\mathbb Z\hookrightarrow
 \mathbb Z/s^b\mathbb Z,
 \qquad 0\le b\le B,
\]

commuting with reduction. The image is obtained by choosing \(r\) children
at each selected node of the \(s\)-ary tree. The choices are shared by
all original labels; no phase is reselected per fibre.

For \(u\in U_r\), put \(N=r^B M\) and define one source map

\[
 F_{u,\theta}(z)\equiv
 \begin{cases}
 u&\pmod {r^A},\\
 \theta_B(z\bmod r^B)&\pmod {s^B},\\
 z&\pmod M.
 \end{cases} \tag{SC2}
\]

CRT makes this an injection from \(\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z\) into the
original period. For an original label write

\[
 d=r^{a(d)}s^{b(d)}m(d),\qquad \gcd(m(d),rs)=1.
\]

Its pullback is empty unless

\[
 u\equiv\alpha_d\pmod {r^{a(d)}}
 \quad\text{and}\quad
 \alpha_d\bmod s^{b(d)}\in\operatorname{im}(\theta_{b(d)}). \tag{SC3}
\]

When nonempty, the pullback is one class of numerical modulus

\[
 \widehat d=r^{b(d)}m(d). \tag{SC4}
\]

The phase is forced by the inverse of \(\theta_{b(d)}\) modulo
\(r^{b(d)}\), together with the original phase modulo \(m(d)\). Thus all
surviving output classes have one original source.

The pure \(r\)-power labels are killed by \(u\in U_r\), so no surviving
pullback has modulus one. The source image is covered by the original
whole cover, hence all nonempty pullbacks cover \(\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z\).
At least \(A\) original labels disappear, so there are fewer than
\(|D|\) output identities.

## 2. EB1 forces a collision in every common-source map

Group original labels by their output numerical modulus. For fixed \(b,m\),
let

\[
 \mathcal P_{b,m}=
 \{\{d,d'\}: d=r^a s^b m,\ d'=r^{a'}s^b m, a<a',\ r^b m>1\}.
 \tag{SC5}
\]

If every output numerical modulus had at most one surviving original,
the pullbacks would be a distinct odd nonunit whole cover with fewer than
\(|D|\) classes, contradicting the first EB1 coordinate. Therefore, for
every \(u\in U_r\) and every compatible \(\theta\), at least one pair in
\(\bigcup_{b,m}\mathcal P_{b,m}\) survives together:

\[
 \boxed{\text{every common-source map has at least one output-label
 collision}.} \tag{SC6}
\]

The collision is numerical, not a duplicate phase. If two surviving labels
in one \(\mathcal P_{b,m}\) had equal output phase, compatibility of the
same \(u\) gives equality of the original phases modulo \(r^a\), and the
common inverse image under \(\theta_b\) gives equality modulo \(s^bm\).
Thus \(A_{d'}\subseteq A_d\), contradicting irredundancy.

This uses the complete source image in (SC2), so it pays the whole covering
liability automatically. It does not select private points separately,
drop higher-owner strata, or replace the original phases.

## 3. A top-layer localization

Let

\[
 T_s=\{d\in D:v_s(d)=B\},\qquad
 L_s=\operatorname{lcm}\{d/s^B:d\in T_s\}.
\]

If \(r\nmid L_s\), every top-layer cofactor is \(r\)-free. Distinct top
labels then have distinct \(m(d)\), hence distinct output moduli
\(r^B m(d)\). A top output cannot collide with a lower output because the
\(r\)-exponents are respectively \(B\) and \(b<B\). Consequently (SC6)
strengthens to

\[
 \boxed{\text{for every }(u,\theta),
 \text{a collision occurs at some }b<B.} \tag{SC7}
\]

This condition is about the top cofactor palette, not absence of \(r\) from
the whole period. Initial-segment support does not imply \(r\nmid L_s\).

## 4. The exact coupled collision moment

Choose \(u\) uniformly from \(U_r\). Independently choose a compatible
embedding by taking a uniformly random \(r\)-subset of the \(s\) children at
each selected node. All labels use this one random tree.

For a pair \(d,d'\in\mathcal P_{b,m}\), define its exact safe-coordinate
factor

\[
 \rho_{d,d'}=
 \frac{|\{u\in U_r:
 u\equiv\alpha_d\pmod {r^a},\ u\equiv\alpha_{d'}\pmod {r^{a'}}\}|}{|U_r|}.\tag{SC8}
\]

Let \(w,w'\) be the original \(s^b\)-prefixes. If \(w=w'\), the probability
that both are in the common embedded tree is

\[
 \kappa_{r,s}(w,w')=\left(\frac rs\right)^b. \tag{SC9}
\]

If their first differing lowest-significant digit occurs after \(\ell<b\)
common digits, then the shared tree choice gives

\[
 \kappa_{r,s}(w,w')=
 \left(\frac rs\right)^\ell
 \frac{r(r-1)}{s(s-1)}
 \left(\frac rs\right)^{2(b-\ell-1)}. \tag{SC10}
\]

The middle factor is essential: the two distinct children must be selected
by the same \(r\)-subset. Treating the two paths as independent replaces
it by an incorrect product.

Define

\[
 \Psi_{r,s}(\mathcal C)=
 \sum_{\{d,d'\}\in\mathscr P_{r,s}}
 \rho_{d,d'}\,\kappa_{r,s}(w_d,w_{d'}), \tag{SC11}
\]

where \(\mathscr P_{r,s}=\bigcup_{b,m}\mathcal P_{b,m}\). Let \(X(u,\theta)\)
be the number of surviving collision pairs. By (SC6), \(X\ge1\) pointwise;
linearity of expectation therefore gives

\[
 \boxed{\Psi_{r,s}(\mathcal C)=\mathbb E[X]\ge1.} \tag{SC12}
\]

Under \(r\nmid L_s\), (SC7) gives the lower-layer version

\[
 \boxed{\sum_{\substack{\{d,d'\}\in\mathscr P_{r,s}\\b(d)<B}}
 \rho_{d,d'}\,\kappa_{r,s}(w_d,w_{d'})\ge1.} \tag{SC13}
\]

No independence between different pair events is used. The same source
coordinate and the same embedding create the joint law.

## 5. What this changes and what remains open

The useful new target is an upper bound

\[
 \Psi_{r,s}(\mathcal C)<1
 \tag{SC14}
\]

for at least one support-prime pair of every hypothetical EB1 cover. Such
an upper bound would contradict (SC12) and settle the cover by a genuine
whole-source argument. A different route is to retain the collision pairs,
cover their complete deleted liability, and prove strict EB1 descent.

The present moment is not an activation-budget lower bound. Its summands
are pairs of original labels, while the blocker budget in report 385 is
indexed by actual quotient atoms. Charging both without a proved map risks
double counting. Likewise, choosing a different safe \(u\) or a different
tree for each column proves only \(\forall\)column\(\exists\) choices, not
the required common \(\exists(u,\theta)\forall\)columns.

The result therefore narrows the unrestricted obligation to a source-global
collision estimate while retaining all original labels, phases, distinct
numeric moduli, and whole-cover quantifiers. It does not claim a
counterexample or a proof of Erdős #7.

## 6. Exact finite kernel check

The accompanying checker enumerates all compatible depth-one and depth-two
embeddings for small \(r<s\), and verifies (SC9)--(SC10) by exact rational
counting. It also verifies the factorization of a pair-survival probability
into the independent safe-coordinate factor (SC8) and the common-tree factor.
It is a kernel check for the new finite probability identity; it does not
instantiate the universal EB1 hypothesis or certify (SC12) for an unknown
cover.
