claim: Generic smooth gluing, metric pullback, covering completeness and curvature transport provide prerequisites for a Mostow-Prasad formalization; the Poincare endpoints do not supply hyperbolic rigidity.

# Reusable geometry from the Poincare library

All source locators below are relative to `PoincareConjecture/` at the
revision in the stable URL. The repository imports work from multiple
upstream authors; `IMPORT.md`, `MODIFICATIONS.md`, the root `LICENSE` and
`NOTICE` provide provenance and licensing. This note cites the sources and
does not vendor code or assert mathematical novelty.

## Endpoint and verification boundary

`PoincareLib/Topology/Manifold/Poincare/Statement.lean` defines two endpoints.
The smooth endpoint is quantified over compact, Hausdorff, second-countable,
simply connected smooth three-manifolds and concludes a diffeomorphism to
`ThreeSphere`. The topological endpoint omits the smooth manifold premise
and concludes a homeomorphism. Both use Mathlib's three-dimensional charted
space and simple connectedness predicates.

`PoincareLib/Topology/Manifold/Poincare.lean` supplies the two endpoint proof
terms, without a predecessor-package argument. `scripts/check_poincare_endpoints.lean`
checks their full recursive axiom closures against `propext`,
`Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound` at every carrier universe. The source's
`verification.md` records endpoint build checks at `516badd1` and comparator
checks at `1876d7dc2c85325a3f62ce9776af98f910c5db04`.
Those are upstream-reported checks; the full endpoint build and comparator
verification have not been independently reproduced in this project.

Poincare classifies the simply connected closed three-manifold. The active
Mostow-Prasad target concerns homotopy equivalences of connected, complete,
finite-volume hyperbolic three-manifolds, including noncompact cusped ones,
and concludes a unique isometry in each homotopy class. The endpoint above
does not supply that existence or uniqueness theorem.

## Generic prerequisites and their direction

| Source module | Declaration | Scope and remaining input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Geometry/Manifold/Gluing/Smooth.lean` | `Poincare.Gluing.quotient_isManifold` | Builds a smooth quotient from open pieces and a supplied smooth overlap system; the orbit-specific overlap system must still be constructed. |
| `Geometry/Manifold/Gluing/Smooth.lean` | `Poincare.Gluing.include_isLocalDiffeomorph` | Piece inclusion is a local diffeomorphism for that gluing; it does not identify the gluing quotient with our orbit quotient. |
| `Geometry/Riemannian/Metric/LocalDiffeomorph.lean` | `PoincareMT.RiemannianMetric.pullbackOfLocalDiffeomorph` | Pulls a smooth positive-definite metric from the target to the source, using the invertible differential; no spatial bijectivity or compactness is required. |
| `Geometry/Riemannian/Covering/Completeness.lean` | `PoincareMT.RiemannianMetric.metricComplete_of_isCoveringMap` | A smooth covering preserving tangent inner products pulls completeness from the base to the covering space, with arbitrary sheet count; it does not prove completeness downstairs from completeness upstairs. |
| `Geometry/Riemannian/Covering/Completeness.lean` | `PoincareMT.RiemannianMetric.metricComplete_pullbackOfLocalDiffeomorph` | The same upward completeness transfer for the actual local-diffeomorphism pullback metric. |
| `Geometry/Riemannian/Curvature/LocalIsometry.lean` | `PoincareMT.LeviCivitaData.curvatureTensor_eq_of_local_isometry` | A smooth map preserving tangent inner products on an open set transports the four-covariant curvature tensor; it needs the two metrics and Levi-Civita data. |
| `Geometry/Riemannian/Curvature/LocalIsometry.lean` | `PoincareMT.LeviCivitaData.curvatureTensorNorm_eq_of_local_isometry` | Transports the retained Hilbert-Schmidt curvature norm under the same hypotheses. |

The `Geometry/` paths in this table have the prefix `PoincareLib/`.
`MetricComplete` means completeness of the emetric obtained from the specified
Riemannian metric by the infimum of path lengths. It is defined in
`Geometry/RicciFlow/Harnack/Basic.lean`; its location explains why that
module appears in the small completeness dependency closure.

## Compatibility result

The external project pins Lean 4.33.1 and Mathlib
`0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474`. Our compatibility experiment uses
Lean 4.33.0 and Mathlib `db584cd6d46c92f209a44c0f1c829460d327499d`.
The covering-completeness closure comprises 14 external source modules,
65,144 bytes excluding Mathlib. All compiled unchanged under our pins.
The union with the curvature-local-isometry and smooth-gluing closures
comprises 47 external source modules, 280,402 bytes excluding Mathlib.
All compiled unchanged under the same pins. The seven public declarations
listed in the table have recursive axiom closures consisting only of
`propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.
This establishes source compatibility for these closures, not installation of
an external dependency or independent verification of the complete Poincare proof.

## Interface still missing for the rigidity target

The project already supplies an isometric representation's orbit covering
under freeness, compact-set proper discontinuity and local compactness,
and a quotient metric inducing the original quotient topology under
compact-set proper discontinuity. Proper ambient spaces additionally give
proper orbit quotients. These prerequisites do not assert finite covolume
or curvature.

For a locally compact metric ambient space, freeness and compact-set proper
discontinuity also give a radius at every point on which the projection to
this orbit metric preserves distance. This application was checked
transiently, without adding a named project theorem. A disjoint neighborhood
contains a ball of radius epsilon, so every nonidentity translate moves its
center by at least epsilon. On the ball of radius epsilon/4, the triangle
inequality makes each nonidentity translate at least as distant as the
identity; taking the orbit infimum therefore gives the original distance.
Ambient properness is unnecessary for this estimate. Kapovich's classical
Lemma 21(3), cited in `kapovich2023properactions.md`, gives local isometry
under metric properness and freeness; that lemma does not assume ambient
properness or geodesicity. Its metric-proper-action hypothesis is distinct
from the compact-set condition used here.

Pinned Mathlib's `Geometry/Manifold/Instances/Quotient.lean` supplies a
charted-space structure for a free properly discontinuous action. It
explicitly leaves smooth manifold structure and smoothness of the projection
as TODOs. The external smooth-gluing theorem is a candidate construction
tool for that gap, not an already supplied smooth orbit projection.

To connect the two libraries, construct the orbit quotient's smooth overlap
system, identify the resulting charts with the chosen quotient topology,
descend the invariant tangent metric, and identify its path distance with
the existing orbit metric. Metric local distance preservation alone does
not discharge these differential-geometric obligations. After this bridge,
curvature transport can carry the model's curvature to the quotient.
Finite volume, the cusp analysis and the global rigidity argument remain
separate mathematical obligations. Compact positive-curvature sphere
covering results cannot be substituted for them.
