# The original theta kernel and xi

On page 2 of the Online First text, equations (1.6)–(1.9) use
`theta(t) = 1 + 2 sum(n>=1) exp(-pi*n^2*t)`,
`omega(t) = sum(n>=1) (2*pi^2*n^4*t^2 - 3*pi*n^2*t)*exp(-pi*n^2*t)`,
and `Phi(x) = 2*exp(x/2)*omega(exp(2*x))`.
The theta modular transformation implies that Phi is even. No absolute value
occurs in this definition of Phi.

Page 3, equations (1.10) and (1.11), states the Mellin representation of xi and
`xi(1/2 + i*z) = integral_R Phi(x)*exp(i*z*x) dx` for complex z, without an
additional prefactor. The repository derives the differential identity
`Phi = psi'' - psi/4`, where `psi(x)=exp(x/2)*(theta(exp(2*x))-1)/2`, and
identifies this original Phi with its fixed even theta kernel. These are
repository object identifications, not claims that the paper uses repository
names or the repository's absolute-value definition.

The paper also treats the physicists' Hermite, Meixner–Pollaczek and continuous
Hahn expansions. Their coefficient integrals, polynomial normalizations and
compact convergence estimates are separate obligations; the theta transform
alone does not establish those expansions or Cardon's equivalence involving
simple zeros and its specific measure and orthogonal polynomials.

## Source anomalies retained

On page 40 the printed c-prime integral omits the factor `2*sqrt(2)` used in the
original c coefficients, while asserting equality of the even coefficients.
The Pollaczek prose says orthonormal, whereas equation (A.12) gives a nonunit
norm. Neither discrepancy is silently repaired or used as an equality here.
The separate Cardon source's odd-extension/jump and recurrence/tail issues
remain separate from Romik's theta formulas.
