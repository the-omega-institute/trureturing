# Reciprocal least confirmation and the spectrality bridge

[Niestegge, arXiv:2312.13213v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13213v2),
Lemma 3(iv), Lemma 5 and Theorem 2(i), give a maximal-value subtraction
argument, joint orthogonal families and spectrality on an order-unit space
with Axioms 1–2 and the proper-effect property $(*)$. Theorem 3 adds
symmetric transition probabilities to obtain a positive definite
self-dualizing inner product. Axiom 1 requires each minimal nonzero extreme
effect to have exactly one normalized state accepting it with certainty;
Axiom 2 requires every pure state to arise from such an effect.

The derivation below is a finite-dimensional premise bridge for the
project's least confirming effects. It uses that subtraction method and
spells out the state–effect and unique-saturation interfaces. It is a
mathematical exposition, not a claim that the cited classification or this
whole bridge has been formalized in Lean. The repository theorem
`D5.S3.Quantum.Foundation.LeastConfirmationGeneration.positive_dual_generation`
proves positive-dual generation, the length bound and the proper-frame bound
under an explicit attained-positive-maximum interface. The remaining
compact-base, state–effect and signed-state bridges below are not
formalized by that theorem.

## Carrier and the retained condition

Use [Definition 26.1 of the quantum-origin volume](../../docs/develop/theory/QUANTUM_ORIGIN_ENDOGENOUS_CUT_ATLAS_AND_DISCRETE_RECONSTRUCTION_BOUNDARIES.md).
Thus $A$ is a nonzero finite-dimensional real vector space, $C$ is a
closed pointed generating cone, and $u$ is strictly positive on
$C\setminus\{0\}$. The normalized base $K=\{x\in C:u(x)=1\}$ is compact.
Write $P=\operatorname{ext}K$. Every effect in the full interval $[0,u]$
is allowed. Order between functionals means order in the dual cone $C^*$.

Retain precisely Principle S:

$$
e_p\in[0,u],\qquad e_p(p)=1,\qquad
e_p\le f\quad(f\in[0,u],\ f(p)=1),
\tag{1}
$$

$$
e_p(q)=e_q(p)\qquad(p,q\in P).
\tag{2}
$$

Leastness in (1) means below every proper confirming effect. It is not
merely minimality, an arbitrary selected test, or leastness among all
positive functionals. No inner product, reversible group, signed frame
spectrality or unique-saturation assumption is supplied.

Ordinary finite-dimensional convex decomposition gives
$K=\operatorname{conv}P$, $C=\operatorname{cone}P$ and
$\operatorname{span}P=A$. These decompositions have no joint
distinguishability requirement. Compactness also makes $u$ an order unit
for $C^*$: every $g\in A^*$ satisfies $-tu\le g\le tu$ for some $t\ge0$.
In particular $C^*$ spans $A^*$.

## Positive dual generation and one common complete frame

Even without (2), leastness implies reciprocal zero readings. If
$e_p(q)=0$, then $u-e_p$ confirms $q$, so $e_q\le u-e_p$ and
$e_q(p)=0$. Exchanging the roles gives the converse.

For $0\ne f\in C^*$, let $M=\max_K f$. This maximum is positive and is
attained at a pure state $p$: the maximizing set is a nonempty compact
face. The rescaled functional $f/M$ belongs to $[0,u]$ and confirms $p$.
Consequently

$$
f_1=f-Me_p\in C^*,\qquad f_1(p)=0.
\tag{3}
$$

Repeat (3) on a nonzero residual. Each new confirming effect vanishes on
every previously chosen pure state, because it is bounded above by a
positive multiple of a residual which vanishes there. Reciprocal zero
readings give the reverse vanishing. The resulting evaluations are
$e_{p_i}(p_j)=\delta_{ij}$. The chosen states are linearly independent, so
after at most $\dim A$ subtractions the residual is exactly zero. Thus

$$
C^*=\operatorname{cone}\{e_p:p\in P\}.
\tag{4}
$$

The zero functional uses an empty decomposition. Neither (2) nor signed
spectrality is needed for (4).

For a finite family with $e_{p_i}(p_j)=\delta_{ij}$, induction using (1)
gives $\sum_i e_{p_i}\le u$: the remaining proper effect confirms the next
state. If $h=u-\sum_i e_{p_i}\ne0$, maximize $h$ at a pure $q$ and put
$M=\max_K h>0$. Leastness gives $e_q\le h/M$, so $e_q(p_i)=0$ and hence
$e_{p_i}(q)=0$. Therefore $M=h(q)=1$. Subtracting $e_q$ preserves a
positive residual. Linear independence again forces finite termination.
Every such family therefore extends to a common complete frame:

$$
e_{p_i}(p_j)=\delta_{ij},\qquad \sum_{i=1}^r e_{p_i}=u.
\tag{5}
$$

The positive decomposition of any $f$ can be completed in this same
frame, with zero coefficients on added members. This supplies an actual
joint effect family under Definition 26.1. It does not replace joint
distinguishability by separately chosen pairwise measurements.

## Reciprocal comparison gives signed spectrality

If $\sum_i a_i p_i=0$, reciprocity gives, for every pure $q$,

$$
\left(\sum_i a_i e_{p_i}\right)(q)
=e_q\left(\sum_i a_i p_i\right)=0.
$$

Since pure states span $A$, the assignment $p\mapsto e_p$ therefore
extends uniquely to a linear map $L:A\to A^*$. By (4), its image contains
$C^*$, which spans $A^*$. It is surjective and hence a linear isomorphism.
Moreover $L(C)=C^*$. Reciprocity makes $B(x,y)=(Lx)(y)$ symmetric; this
alone has not yet established positive definiteness.

Given arbitrary $x\in A$, choose $t\ge0$ with $Lx+tu\in C^*$. Use (3)–(5)
to write, in one and the same complete frame,

$$
Lx+tu=\sum_i\lambda_i e_{p_i},\qquad
u=\sum_i e_{p_i},\qquad \lambda_i\ge0.
$$

Injectivity of $L$ now gives

$$
x=\sum_i(\lambda_i-t)p_i,\qquad
B(x,x)=\sum_i(\lambda_i-t)^2.
\tag{6}
$$

This is the original signed frame condition Sp, derived from S. The
square sum is strictly positive when $x\ne0$. Finally $L(C)=C^*$ gives

$$
C=\{x\in A:B(x,y)\ge0\text{ for every }y\in C\}.
\tag{7}
$$

The order-unit bound for arbitrary dual functionals is essential here.
A spanning family of normalized probes and maximum attainment only for
positive functionals suffice for positive-dual generation, but do not
alone imply that the dual cone spans the full dual space. Compactness and
the full closed-cone carrier supply that extra bridge in (6).

Thus Sp is redundant relative to the stated S on this carrier. This is
a revelation of an existing dependence between written premises; it does
not remove finite dimensionality, convex mixing, full effect availability
or leastness. Theorem 26.2's three norm formulas then apply to their
specified norms, with no identification of the operational base norm with
the self-dualizing inner-product norm.

## Exact interface to the cited theorems

Each $e_p$ is extreme in $[0,u]$: a convex decomposition into proper
effects forces both components to confirm $p$, and leastness forces both
to equal $e_p$. If a pure $q$ satisfies $e_p(q)=1$, reciprocity and
leastness give $e_p=e_q$. Reciprocity then gives identical evaluations of
$p,q$ by every $e_r$. Equation (4) implies these effects span $A^*$, so
$p=q$. Ordinary pure-state convex decomposition extends this to

$$
\{x\in K:e_p(x)=1\}=\{p\}.
\tag{8}
$$

A nonzero extreme proper effect $a$ has $\max_K a=1$: otherwise
$a=M(a/M)+(1-M)0$ with $0<M<1$ is a nontrivial convex decomposition.
Choose a pure $q$ attaining that maximum. If also $a\le e_p$, (8) gives
$q=p$, so $e_p\le a$ and $a=e_p$. Hence the $e_p$ are exactly the minimal
nonzero extreme proper effects.

Taking the source's order-unit space to be $(A^*,C^*,u)$ now supplies
Axiom 1 from (8), Axiom 2 from $p\leftrightarrow e_p$, and proper $(*)$
from (1). The information capacity is at most $\dim A$ by frame linear
independence. The source's Theorems 2–3 therefore have the required
premises. The subtraction technique and its spectral consequences are
existing literature; this note does not claim a new general spectral or
classification theorem.

The domain in v2 §3's displayed $(**)$ is different: it takes an infimum
over all positive affine functionals normalized at one state, with no
upper bound by $u$. The [qubit scope test](mullerududec2012selfduality.md#scope-tests)
shows why proper leastness cannot be substituted into that domain. The
bridge here uses proper $(*)$ and Theorems 2–3, and does not invoke
Theorem 1's passage to $(**)$.

## What this geometry does and does not select

The derived pairing identifies a pure state with its least confirming
effect: the object and its reference test occupy the same real geometry.
Positive dual readings can be separated into jointly distinguishable
directions, and the same complete frame permits signed decompositions.
These statements do not require a supplied reversible symmetry group.

Classical simplices and real, complex and quaternionic Jordan systems
remain examples. The candidate does not by itself select a complex
Hilbert space, a tensor product, an allowed instrument menu, complete
positivity, a clock or a Hamiltonian. Endpoint reciprocity does not make
successive physical measurements commute. The full composition and
process contracts in the [spectral strong-symmetry note](barnumhilgert2019spectral.md#complete-conditional-reconstruction-and-its-remaining-contracts)
remain separate obligations.

In ordinary words: each pure state has one least confirming test which
every other certain confirmation must contain, and two pure states give
the same cross-reading when their roles are exchanged. Repeatedly remove
the direction with the largest positive reading; leastness keeps the
remainder positive, and finite dimension makes the removal stop. The
reciprocal rule lets states and tests share one geometry. Spectral
decomposition is a consequence to derive within that model, while
complex-field selection and physical evolution require further bridges.
