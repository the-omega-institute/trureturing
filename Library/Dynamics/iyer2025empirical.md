# A collapsed posterior noise measure and its group variation

Iyer and Venkatraman, [arXiv:2512.17794v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17794v1),
Proposition 2.2, PDF page 5, gives an exact second-moment identity for an
i.i.d. empirical measure on Euclidean space after Gaussian smoothing.
Section 5, pages 13–14, derives the identity by independence and centering.
The end of that proof permits zero smoothing when the Hilbert smoothness
index exceeds half the dimension. Theorem 1.1 addresses more general
Lp-based negative Sobolev norms. These are antecedents for measuring point
fluctuations in a topology weaker than measure total variation.

Chapter 42 of [the posterior-field volume](../../docs/develop/theory/PARITY_HIDDEN_ARROW_POSTERIOR_FIELD.md)
uses a length-four circle, an explicitly normalized Fourier norm, and
conditionally independent but heterogeneous Bernoulli labels only under
its auxiliary law. Its Hilbert second-moment identity is proved directly
by vanishing cross terms. Summability of the Fourier weights proves norm
continuity of a moving Dirac mass for s greater than one half. Neither
that computation nor the threshold is claimed as new. The Euclidean
i.i.d. theorem is not invoked as a theorem about the actual dependent
pair/path observations or their fixed-size posterior.

A second direct methodological precedent is Berend and Kontorovich,
*On the Convergence of the Empirical Distribution*,
[arXiv:1205.6711v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6711v2).
Lemma 8, PDF page 5, bounds the expected l1 error of a countable empirical
distribution by the sum of square roots of its probabilities divided by
the square root of sample size. Equation (5) and Theorem 3, page 3,
give the resulting countable-support tail bound when that square-root
sum is finite. The elementary Cauchy–Schwarz step is exactly the
precedent for summing square roots of group intensities. The paper's
fixed countable i.i.d. sampling law differs from the changing arithmetic
groups and conditional label law here. Its l1 convention equals the full
variation norm of the signed error; Chapter 42 also uses full variation,
without a one-half probability-distance factor.

The `repo-derived` content is the actual-model combination. The same
posterior noise that has a resolved Brownian profile collapses to its
own Gaussian endpoint times a Dirac mass in the stated Hilbert norm,
while its aggregated whole-score-group variation grows as Q to the
one-quarter power with an explicit positive constant. Uniform actual
point-group occupancy, a nonlinear square-root Riemann sum and a
summable square-root-intensity tail estimate establish that constant.
Cumulative variance-clock convergence alone does not prove those steps.

The exact fixed-size posterior is handled by one complete label-vector
comparison and the simultaneous subset-center bound from
[Siripraparat–Neammanee's local-probability application](siripraparat2021local.md).
Applying that bound to the positive and negative center-error subsets
controls the sum of absolute errors. Group variation aggregates all
equal-score labels before taking absolute values; summing individual
label magnitudes gives a different statistic. One common data and label
realization couples the measure with the full endpoint and profile.

The conclusion concerns probability and distributional convergence in
the specified Hilbert and compact path spaces. It does not transfer
actual moments through total variation, claim an extra independent
Gaussian amplitude, assert a different path topology, or provide an
all-amplitude or growing-window theorem. The primary precedents delimit
the classical tools; the bounded comparison is not a global originality
certificate.
