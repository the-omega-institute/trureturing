claim: The localized Weil operator has a continuous lowest eigenvalue and a positive simple even ground state at sufficiently small support; a specified locally uniform spectral limit would imply RH but remains an additional hypothesis. Positive shifted operators do not supply unshifted positivity at all scales.

# Localized Weil operators and the spectral-limit obligation

The primary source is [Suzuki, arXiv:2606.09096v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.09096v3), submitted **23 September 2026**. The latest version history, selected theorem statements and their differences from v2 were checked on 1 October. This note does not assert independent verification of the whole preprint, its external inputs or a Lean implementation.

## Small support and shifted positivity

For the source's localized Weil operator $A_a$ on $L^2(-a,a)$, Theorem 1.3 states continuity of the lowest eigenvalue $\lambda_a$ in $a$. Theorem 1.4 gives positivity, simplicity and an even ground eigenfunction for **sufficiently small $a>0$**, with its stated small-$a$ asymptotic. These core statements were already in v2 and are not new September discoveries.

Choosing a real $\lambda<\lambda_a$ makes $T_{a,\lambda}=A_a-\lambda I$ positive and supports the Hilbert-space construction. It does not prove $A_a\ge0$. The paper explicitly distinguishes this shift from the unshifted choice $\lambda=0$, whose availability at every sufficiently large scale has RH strength. The expected limiting identification is not obtained by choosing the shift alone.

## The exact limit in v3

Corollary 1.6 assumes choices $\lambda(a)<\lambda_a$, $\theta(a)\in[0,2\pi)$ and a function $\phi(a,z)$ **analytic in the upper half-plane**, for all sufficiently large $a$, such that

$$
e^{\phi(a,z)}W(a,\theta(a);z)
\longrightarrow
\frac{\xi(1/2-iz)}{\xi(1/2-iz)+\xi'(1/2-iz)}
$$

uniformly on every compact subset of that half-plane. Under these hypotheses the corollary concludes RH. Here $W$ is the entire function constructed from the adjoint operator's boundary form in Theorem 1.5; its zeros are precisely the eigenvalues of the specified self-adjoint extension. It also depends on the chosen shift $\lambda(a)$. The limit is a hypothesis; it is not the paper's unconditional conclusion. Compared with the inspected v2 statement, v3 explicitly states the shift inequality, analyticity of the factor's exponent and locally uniform convergence on this domain. Pointwise agreement or sampled eigenvalue agreement cannot replace this limit contract. Section 7 motivates the formula under RH; it is not an unconditional proof of the required limit.

## A related compact-window source and its current range

[arXiv:2608.24827v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.24827v2), submitted **2 September 2026**, is listed under **Xuefeng Zhu**. The arXiv history explicitly says the author name and affiliation were updated; its v1 lists **Marcus Chuk**. Thus the older author's name in the [project's August account](../../docs/develop/theory/GOLDEN_OBSERVER_RH_ROUTE.md) identifies the earlier version, not a different theorem automatically missing a source.

In v2, Theorem 1.2 states a computer-assisted lower bound for real even tests supported in $[-0.8,0.8]$. Theorem 6.2 supplies the parity and ground-state separation, and Corollary 6.3 states the extension

$$
Q(f)\ge8.9\cdot10^{-18}\|f\|_2^2
\qquad (\operatorname{supp}f\subseteq[-0.8,0.8])
$$

for complex $L^2(\mathbb R)$ tests, using its Weil-form convention. These are the preprint's claimed certified results; the certificate programs were not independently rerun for this note. This is one fixed support window, not all-support Weil positivity.

Section 7 expressly retracts an **earlier draft's** claimed certificate at $L=1.19$, or autocorrelation support $2.38$: replacing the true prime-comb envelope by a smaller per-prime quantity used the bound in the wrong direction, so the reduced positive matrix did not bound the actual form. The checked v1 already states the $L=0.8$ range and does not contain that $2.38$ theorem. Hence v2's retraction should not be described as downgrading a theorem found in the arXiv v1. The positive exploratory matrix at $L=1.19$ is not a valid certificate for the full form.

The precise Landau–Widom profile is Conjecture 12.1, supported by fitted finite data. Theorem 1.3's qualitative decay bound explicitly **assumes RH**. Neither statement supplies an unconditional all-scale lower bound. The fixed-window numerical certificates, a conjectural asymptotic profile and the conditional decay theorem have different evidentiary roles.

## Reuse in the FIB scale program

The project already has [golden support-layer positivity induction](../../D5/S3/Weil/TestFunctions/GoldenPositivityInduction.lean), [infinite-complement leakage bounds](../../D5/S3/Weil/ZetaBridge/WeilInfiniteComplementLeakage.lean) and [an arithmetic boundary coupling jet](../../D5/S3/Weil/ZetaBridge/WeilArithmeticCouplingJet.lean). Their stated assumptions and Fourier/form-identification boundaries remain in force; this source review did not rebuild them. A generic recurrence or Schur-complement reduction should be reused. The remaining work is an estimate for the actual arithmetic form that pays for the coupling to each new test space, uniformly over all its coefficients and with the required scale and tail controls. Neither a positive shifted model nor fixed-window positivity supplies that estimate.
