claim: The full bounded-support Weil operator has discrete lower-bounded spectrum, and an explicit auxiliary transform converges to Xi. Actual ground-state simplicity, evenness and comparison with that auxiliary function remain missing; the shifted spectral construction does not certify the original form's sign.

# Spectral construction and the actual Weil comparison

The [EMS publication record](https://doi.org/10.4171/elm/37/3) identifies the chapter published on 23 June 2026. The complete primary text inspected here is [arXiv:2511.22755v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22755v1), 27 November 2025. Its PDF SHA-256 is `c98d89f7fc999d038e15e80a9aaaee2af797c17711c4329ca7ce48ad49cb336b`. The publisher-edition full text was unavailable; equality of that edition with the inspected preprint is not asserted. The source results below are references for reuse, without independent proof verification, numerical reproduction or Lean implementation.

## Established results to reuse

The following locators refer to the inspected preprint's printed pages.

| Locator | Source result | Condition or limit relevant to this project |
|---|---|---|
| Proposition 3.4, pp.8–9 | The Fourier/Laurent-polynomial space is a form core; finite-section minima converge to the full lower bound. | No effective error rate or nonnegative lower bound is supplied. This proposition is attributed to the earlier Connes–Consani work. |
| Theorem 3.6, p.9 | The canonical full Weil operator at fixed support has discrete lower-bounded spectrum. | A lower bound need not be nonnegative; discreteness does not determine its sign. |
| Theorem 5.10, p.23 | A modified scaling operator is selfadjoint in the specified quotient metric, and its regularized determinant is expressed using an entire Fourier transform with only real zeros. | The finite-section minimum must be simple, its eigenvector even, and its Dirichlet evaluation normalized to one. |
| Lemma 7.3, pp.31–32 | The transform of the specified auxiliary $k_\lambda$ converges to Riemann's $\Xi$ uniformly on closed substrips of $\lvert\operatorname{Im}z\rvert<1/2$. | This concerns the auxiliary prolate-based function, not a proved approximation of the actual Weil ground eigenfunction. |

The theorem's quotient metric is the restriction of

$$
QW_\lambda^N-\epsilon_N\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle,
$$

where $\epsilon_N$ is the original finite-section minimum. Its positivity is a property of the shifted quotient. The construction supplies no sign bound for $\epsilon_N$. The [distributional precursor and its explicit negative example](connesvansuijlekom2025quadratic.md) give another reason to preserve this distinction. Rebuilding the spectral construction would not supply the missing unshifted estimate.

## Common-function parameter map

Use $L>0$ for the project's additive half-width, avoiding the source's use of an interval-length parameter:

$$
\lambda=e^L=\sqrt c,\qquad u=e^x,\qquad g(u)=f(\log u),
\qquad d^*u=du/u=dx.
$$

Thus $\operatorname{supp}f\subseteq[-L,L]$ corresponds to $\operatorname{supp}g\subseteq[\lambda^{-1},\lambda]$, and additive evenness corresponds to multiplicative inversion symmetry. Equations (3.7)–(3.11) retain the prime-power weights, Gamma multiplier and both pole evaluations. In particular,

$$
\widehat g(\pm i/2)=\int f(x)e^{\pm x/2}\,dx.
$$

For even $f$ these evaluations agree; they are not required to vanish. The auxiliary construction's zero-integral condition is a condition on its profile, not permission to restrict the project's arbitrary even tests. The [existing joint pole–prime–Gamma account](frankliebseiringer2006hardy.md) continues to own that common-test decomposition.

## The source's remaining steps

Section 8, pp.32–33, explicitly leaves two steps unresolved: the actual Weil minimum must be simple with an even eigenvector, and $k_\lambda$ must approximate a correctly scaled actual ground eigenfunction sufficiently accurately to transfer convergence of transforms. The corresponding properties of the prolate-wave operator do not establish those properties for the Weil operator.

One concrete comparison target is, for the same actual ground eigenfunction $\xi_\lambda$ and an explicitly controlled nonzero normalization $a_\lambda$,

$$
\int_{\lambda^{-1}}^\lambda
|a_\lambda\xi_\lambda(u)-k_\lambda(u)|
\max(u^\sigma,u^{-\sigma})\,\frac{du}{u}\longrightarrow0,
\qquad 0\le\sigma<1/2.
$$

This is an outstanding weighted-transform interface, not a bound proved by this note. Norm convergence at changing support does not by itself provide its weights or normalization. The [effective prolate concentration bounds](karnikrombergdavenport2021prolate.md) concern another operator and do not supply this comparison.

For the positivity route, the outstanding supplier instead concerns the actual full-form even-sector finite-section error. If $m_L^+$ is the true even-sector minimum and $m_{L,N}^+$ a retained minimum, the needed certified comparison has the form

$$
0\le m_{L,N}^+-m_L^+\le r(L,N),
$$

with a lower certificate for $m_{L,N}^+$ large enough to pay $r(L,N)$. Core density supplies no explicit $r$. This note obtains neither that estimate nor cofinal positivity. The two routes have different missing interfaces.

An unbounded FIB support schedule selects a cofinal family of windows. It supplies none of the actual simplicity, evenness, normalization, weighted comparison or finite-section errors above. Existing generic cofinal and Schur results should be reused; new work must address the actual arithmetic operator. RH remains unproved.
