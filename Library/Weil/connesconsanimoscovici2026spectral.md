# Spectral construction and the actual Weil comparison

The [EMS publication record](https://doi.org/10.4171/elm/37/3) identifies the chapter published on 23 June 2026. The complete primary text inspected here is [arXiv:2511.22755v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22755v1), 27 November 2025. Its PDF SHA-256 is `c98d89f7fc999d038e15e80a9aaaee2af797c17711c4329ca7ce48ad49cb336b`. The publisher-edition full text was unavailable; equality of that edition with the inspected preprint is not asserted. The source results below are references for reuse, without independent proof verification, numerical reproduction or Lean implementation.

## Established results to reuse

The following locators refer to the inspected preprint's printed pages.

| Locator | Source result | Condition or limit relevant to this project |
|---|---|---|
| Proposition 3.4, pp.8–9 | The Fourier/Laurent-polynomial space is a form core; finite-section minima converge to the full lower bound. | No effective error rate or nonnegative lower bound is supplied. This proposition is attributed to the earlier Connes–Consani work. |
| Theorem 3.6, p.9 | The canonical full Weil operator at fixed support has discrete lower-bounded spectrum. | A lower bound need not be nonnegative; discreteness does not determine its sign. |
| Theorem 5.10, p.23 | A modified scaling operator is selfadjoint in the specified quotient metric, and its regularized determinant is expressed using an entire Fourier transform with only real zeros. | The finite-section minimum must be simple, its eigenvector even, and its Dirichlet evaluation normalized to one. |
| Lemma 7.3, pp.31–32 | The transform of the specified auxiliary $k_\lambda$ converges to Riemann's $\Xi$ uniformly on closed substrips of $\lvert\operatorname{Im}z\rvert<1/2$. | This concerns the auxiliary prolate-based function, not a proved approximation of the actual Weil ground eigenfunction. |

The theorem's quotient metric is the restriction of

$$
QW_\lambda^N-\epsilon_N\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle,
$$

where $\epsilon_N$ is the original finite-section minimum. Its positivity is a property of the shifted quotient. The construction supplies no sign bound for $\epsilon_N$. The [distributional precursor and its explicit negative example](connesvansuijlekom2025quadratic.md) give another reason to preserve this distinction. Rebuilding the spectral construction would not supply the missing unshifted estimate.

## Common-function parameter map

Use $L>0$ for the project's additive half-width, avoiding the source's use of an interval-length parameter:

$$
\lambda=e^L=\sqrt c,\qquad u=e^x,\qquad g(u)=f(\log u),
\qquad d^*u=du/u=dx.
$$

Thus $\operatorname{supp}f\subseteq[-L,L]$ corresponds to $\operatorname{supp}g\subseteq[\lambda^{-1},\lambda]$, and additive evenness corresponds to multiplicative inversion symmetry. Equations (3.7)–(3.11) retain the prime-power weights, Gamma multiplier and both pole evaluations. In particular,

$$
\widehat g(\pm i/2)=\int f(x)e^{\pm x/2}\,dx.
$$

For even $f$ these evaluations agree; they are not required to vanish. The auxiliary construction's zero-integral condition is a condition on its profile, not permission to restrict the project's arbitrary even tests. The [existing joint pole–prime–Gamma account](frankliebseiringer2006hardy.md) continues to own that common-test decomposition.

## The source's remaining steps

Section 8, pp.32–33, explicitly leaves two steps unresolved: the actual Weil minimum must be simple with an even eigenvector, and $k_\lambda$ must approximate a correctly scaled actual ground eigenfunction sufficiently accurately to transfer convergence of transforms. The corresponding properties of the prolate-wave operator do not establish those properties for the Weil operator.

One concrete comparison target is, for the same actual ground eigenfunction $\xi_\lambda$ and an explicitly controlled nonzero normalization $a_\lambda$,

$$
\int_{\lambda^{-1}}^\lambda
|a_\lambda\xi_\lambda(u)-k_\lambda(u)|
\max(u^\sigma,u^{-\sigma})\,\frac{du}{u}\longrightarrow0,
\qquad 0\le\sigma<1/2.
$$

This is an outstanding weighted-transform interface, not a bound proved by this note. Norm convergence at changing support does not by itself provide its weights or normalization. The [effective prolate concentration bounds](karnikrombergdavenport2021prolate.md) concern another operator and do not supply this comparison.

For the positivity route, the outstanding supplier instead concerns the actual full-form even-sector finite-section error. If $m_L^+$ is the true even-sector minimum and $m_{L,N}^+$ a retained minimum, the needed certified comparison has the form

$$
0\le m_{L,N}^+-m_L^+\le r(L,N),
$$

with a lower certificate for $m_{L,N}^+$ large enough to pay $r(L,N)$. Core density supplies no explicit $r$. This note obtains neither that estimate nor cofinal positivity. The two routes have different missing interfaces.

An unbounded FIB support schedule selects a cofinal family of windows. It supplies none of the actual simplicity, evenness, normalization, weighted comparison or finite-section errors above. Existing generic cofinal and Schur results should be reused; new work must address the actual arithmetic operator. RH remains unproved.

## A proved high-energy law and its four-component characteristic geometry

Taira–Willems–Wrochna, *Large eigenvalues of the Connes–Moscovici
operator*, [arXiv:2609.32639v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2609.32639v1),
26 September 2026, proves the logarithmic Weyl law previously predicted
for a specified Connes–Moscovici operator. The inspected primary has
45 pages and PDF SHA-256
`49cf5e3863459148b249c9ae721c2297024f1f1055025ba8ef9ed87c8893ffbb`.
The interfaces used here are Theorem 1.1 and Corollary 1.2 on p.2,
the explicit spectral-scope statement on p.5, §§2.1–2.4 on pp.7–10,
the counting argument in §5.3 on p.36, and Theorem A.11 on p.41.
This is a primary-source
application, not an independent audit of the microlocal proof,
numerical reproduction, new spectral theorem or Lean verification.

### The proved operator and its parameters

The differential expression and its distinguished selfadjoint extension
are

$$
P=-\partial_x(x^2-1)\partial_x-4\pi^2x^2,
\qquad P_{\rm sa}:D(P_{\rm sa})\subset L^2(\mathbb R)\to L^2(\mathbb R).
$$

Section 2.4 fixes the domain: the logarithmic terms at $x=\pm1$
are excluded, and the even and odd parts have respectively the
specified sine-type and cosine-type boundary conditions at infinity.
The differential expression alone does not specify this extension.
The spectrum is discrete and unbounded in both directions. The older
Connes–Moscovici notation uses $W_{\rm sa}=-P_{\rm sa}$ and calls the
relevant eigenvalues negative; its parameter called $E$ is the square
root of the present eigenvalue parameter, as Remark 1.6 explains.

With

$$
I(a)=\int_1^\infty\left(
\sqrt{\frac{x^2+a-1}{x^2-1}}-1\right)dx\qquad(a>0),
$$

Theorem 1.1 gives some $E_*>0$ and a smooth remainder such that

$$
R(E)=-\frac{\log E}{16\pi\sqrt E}+O(E^{-1/2}),
\qquad R'(E)=O(E^{-3/2}\log E).
$$

All sufficiently large positive eigenvalues are simple and are
characterized, with $n\in\tfrac12\mathbb Z$ sufficiently large, by

$$
2I\left(1+\frac{E_n}{4\pi^2}\right)+\frac14+R(E_n)
=n+O(E_n^{-\infty}).
\tag{W1}
$$

No numerical value of $E_*$ or explicit constants for these remainder
symbols are supplied by this application. Corollary 1.2 proves

$$
N_+(E)=\frac{4\sqrt E}{2\pi}
\left(\log\frac{\sqrt E}{2\pi}-1+2\log2\right)+O(1).
\tag{W2}
$$

Thus setting $T=4\sqrt E$ gives exactly the main counting function
$T\log(T/(2\pi e))/(2\pi)$ of the classical Riemann–von Mangoldt
formula. This is a parameter match for the main term, not an
identification of individual eigenvalues or of the oscillating zero
count. The primary explicitly preserves that distinction on p.5.
High-energy simplicity in (W1) is also a statement about $P_{\rm sa}$;
it is not the missing simplicity of the actual Weil ground state in
the preceding spectral-triple discussion.

### A literal four-phase symmetry after the scale is recorded

The source uses $E=h^{-2}$ and the global $h$-dependent real symbol

$$
p_h(x,\xi)=(x^2-1)\xi^2-4\pi^2h^2x^2-1,
\qquad h>0.
$$

Put $a_h=2\pi h$ and $y=\xi/a_h$. Then its characteristic equation
becomes the symmetric relation

$$
p_h(x,a_hy)=0
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
(x^2-1)(y^2-1)=1+a_h^{-2}.
\tag{W3}
$$

Both $|x|$ and $|y|$ exceed one on this curve. There are four
components labeled by their two signs, and

$$
C(x,y)=(-y,x),\qquad C^2=-I,\quad C^4=I
$$

preserves (W3), cycling the labels as
$(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)\mapsto(-\sigma_2,\sigma_1)$.
In the original symbol coordinates this is

$$
B_h=\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&a_h\end{pmatrix},\qquad
\mathcal C_h=B_hCB_h^{-1}
=\begin{pmatrix}0&-a_h^{-1}\\a_h&0\end{pmatrix},
\qquad p_h(\mathcal C_h(x,\xi))=p_h(x,\xi).
\tag{W4}
$$

The last identity follows by substitution, and
$\det\mathcal C_h=1$ preserves the two-dimensional symplectic form.
This action exchanges the ends approaching $x=\pm1$, $|\xi|=\infty$
with the ends approaching spatial infinity and $\xi=\pm a_h$.
It is a scale-dependent transport of position and momentum boundaries.
Using the unscaled quarter-turn on $(x,\xi)$ instead would give

$$
p_h(C(x,\xi))-p_h(x,\xi)
=(a_h^2-1)(x^2-\xi^2),
$$

which is not identically zero at general $h$. The scale factor in
(W4) therefore cannot be dropped.

The matrix $C$ in normalized coordinates is the same algebraic matrix
as the existing FIB composition operation $C=MJ$ in the
[FIB volume, §149](../../docs/develop/theory/FIBONACCI_ATOMIC_RELATION_GENERATION.md).
This supplies a concrete common four-phase action after the coordinate
normalization is specified. It does not identify the integer composition
carrier with this continuous characteristic curve. Symbol invariance
alone does not establish a unitary action on the chosen operator domain
or compatibility with the full boundary conditions and quantization
remainder in (W1).

There is, independently, an existing operator-level Fourier symmetry
to reuse. Appendix A, Theorem A.11 on p.41, recalls Connes–Moscovici,
*The UV prolate spectrum matches the zeros of zeta*,
[PNAS 119 (2022), e2123174119, Theorem 1.6](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2123174119):
this same $P_{\rm sa}$ commutes with the source's Fourier transform
$\mathcal F$, the interval projection $Q$, and
$\widehat Q=\mathcal FQ\mathcal F^{-1}$. It is the unique selfadjoint
extension of $P_{\min}$ commuting with $Q$ and $\widehat Q$.
Thus the Fourier compatibility of this specified extension is already
established source mathematics, rather than a new obligation to prove
from (W4). The original theorem is used here as recalled in the inspected
primary; no new audit of the 2022 proof is claimed. It does not identify
the functional Fourier action with a transformation of legal FIB sources.

A FIB-to-spectral bridge would still need a map from legal recursive
sources to this operator's admitted data, an intertwining of the actual
recursion and observations, and the quantization and arithmetic
correspondence. Counting four components or sharing the matrix $C$
does not construct that map. In particular the five-window address
rules are not boundary conditions for $P_{\rm sa}$.

The high-energy theorem should be reused in its own spectral model.
It neither settles the actual Weil ground-state comparison nor bounds
the complete signed $I_\psi(\log N)$ at the selected Robin source.
Those arithmetic estimates and RH remain unproved.
